# Team Photos Directory

Place team member photos in this directory. The website will automatically display them on the team page.

## File Names Required

Replace the placeholder files with actual photos using these exact filenames:

### Executive Leadership:
- `marcus-thorne.jpg` - CEO Marcus Thorne
- `rachel-morrison.jpg` - Dr. Rachel Morrison (CTO)
- `james-chen.jpg` - James Chen (COO)
- `sarah-kaplan.jpg` - Sarah Kaplan (CLO)
- `michael-patterson.jpg` - Michael Patterson (CSO)
- `lisa-park.jpg` - Chief Lisa Park (Community Relations)
- `amara-voss.jpg` - Dr. Amara Voss (Chief Data Scientist)

## Image Specifications

For best results, your images should be:

- **Format**: JPG, PNG, or WebP
- **Size**: 400x400 pixels minimum (will be displayed as circular)
- **Aspect Ratio**: Square (1:1)
- **File Size**: Under 500KB for fast loading
- **Quality**: High resolution, professional headshots
- **Background**: Solid color or professional setting

## Fallback Behavior

If an image file is missing or fails to load, the website will automatically display:
- A colored circular avatar with the person's initials
- The gradient background matches the company branding

## How to Add Photos

1. Save your photo with the exact filename from the list above
2. Place it in this `images/team/` directory
3. Refresh the website - the photo will appear automatically!

## Tips for Best Results

✓ Use professional headshots with good lighting  
✓ Crop images to focus on the face  
✓ Maintain consistent style across all photos  
✓ Use neutral or professional backgrounds  
✓ Ensure faces are centered in the frame
